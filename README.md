Taken
=============
Taken is a platform to help human trafficking victims leave a clue behind so that people who might be looking for them have a place to start. 

Taken will also be used by human trafficking witnesses to speak out and also provide information to authorities about cases they might have witnessed in a bid to help put a stop to human trafficking.
